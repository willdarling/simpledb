Describe any design decisions you made, including methods for selectivity estimation,
join ordering, as well as any of the bonus exercises you chose to implement and how
you implemented them (for each bonus exercise you may submit up to 1 additional page).

  Almost all the design decisions for this lab were taken straight from the instructions, 
  such as the formulas for selectivity estimation in IntHistogram, and the formulas for
  join cardinality and cost estimation in JoinOptimizer. Where the instructions gave us
  some creative leeway was in the TableStats constructor and how we chose to scan the 
  table. We implemented a unique solution to finding mins and maxs for the necessary
  IntHistograms. During the inital tuple counting scan, instead of throwing a tuple
  away after counting it, we checked every single field against two arrays that held
  max/mins for that field (up to the current tuple) in its corresponding indice and 
  replaced the max/min value as necessary. Unfortunately, we could only limit our number
  of scans to two, since we can't add tuples to the histograms until we know the min/max
  for that field (which requires at least one full scan).

Discuss and justify any changes you made to the API.

  We did not make any changes to the API.

Describe any missing or incomplete elements of your code.

  Nothing is missing or incomplete.

Describe how you and your partner split the work. 

  William began implementing IntHistogram, while AK focused on TableStats. However, it
  took AK longer to implement TableStats than first anticipated due to his unfamiliarity
  with iterators. In the meantime, William implemented all of JoinOptimizer. When it
  became clear we couldn't test JoinOptimizer without TableStats functionality, we both
  came together and comlpeted TableStats jointly.

Describe how long you spent on the lab, and whether there was anything
you found particularly difficult or confusing.

  We spent about ten hours each on this lab. AK found difficulty in figuring out how to
  scan the table and what to look for to add to TableStats.
